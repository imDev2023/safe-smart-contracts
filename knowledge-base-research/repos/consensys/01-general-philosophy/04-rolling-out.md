# Rolling out

Tip

For comprehensive insights into secure development practices, consider visiting the [Development Recommendations](https://scsfg.io/developers/) section of the Smart Contract Security Field Guide. This resource provides in-depth articles to guide you in developing robust and secure smart contracts.

It is always better to catch bugs before a full production release.

*   Test contracts thoroughly, and add tests whenever new attack vectors are discovered
*   Provide [bug bounties](https://consensysdiligence.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/bug-bounty-programs/) starting from alpha testnet releases
*   Rollout in phases, with increasing usage and testing in each phase
